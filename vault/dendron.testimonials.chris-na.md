> Dendron has given me the opportunity to have a one-stop place for all my notes, random thoughts and project planning right where i feel at home - in VSCode. To anyone feeling overwhelmed by planning and structuring everything from the start: just don't. Simply start noting down things that are important to you and patterns will emerge. Refactoring is easy.
> 
> Kevin is such a welcoming and open-minded guy and his professionalism and transparency in handling Dendron impressed me greatly. 9 out of 10 feature suggestions i had after using Dendron for a while, he already had in mind or even planned for a milestone.
> 
> I use Dendron mostly to manage multiple projects to keep track of meeting notes, TODOs, planned features and sharing all of this with my colleagues.
