# 2020 principles and values

## Goals

Come up with governing principals and values for the Dendron product and the Dendron Community

## Details

### Product Principles
- speed: Dendron should be the fastest way for **people** to access the information they care about
- ownership: users should have **full control** of their data and it should be our first principle to maximize this as much as possibility
- interoperability: it should be possible to import/export your data from/to any other source where a user might want to use their information
- easy to learn, hard to master: see [Bushnell's Law
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushnell%27s_Law#:~:text=Bushnell's%20Law%20or%20Nolan's%20Law,first%20quarter%20and%20the%20hundredth.)

### Community Values

- open and inclusive: Dendron is a tool for **all users** that are interested in creating, building, using, and sharing knowledge. full stop. 
- documentation first: we don't just share what we learn in a chat at a moment in time. we make sure that the information remains accessible longer after we are gone. we do this by documenting useful information in [dendron](http://dendron.so/)
- have it in writing
