Dendron 0.47 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

### Highlights
- **Seed bank in preview**! This marks a meaningful step towards modularizing knowledge to make it easy to compose existing information and build upon it. We invite you to [[get started here.|dendron.topic.seed-bank]]
- **Calendar view for daily journal.** At a glance, view all your daily journal notes along with indicators displaying how much you've written each day. [[See it in action.|dendron.ref.web-ui#dendron-calendar-view]]
-**Set default for daily journal notes.** When you've got multiple vaults, it's a pain to keep having to remember which vault should contain your daily journal. No more! The fix for [#628](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/628) is here. 
- **Airtable pod.** We ðŸ’– Airtable at Dendron and for fellow Airheads (that's a thing right ...), we built this pod so you can export your notes to an Airtable base. More details [[here|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.airtable]]
- **Graph view can now be filtered** by vault or by regex (on note name)

### Docs

Our documentation changes a lot week by week. Below is a highlight of some updates from the past week.

- Updated config with details on [[default daily journal|dendron.topic.config.dendron#defaultdailyjournalvault,1:#*]]
- Updated docs for the [[dendron.topic.seed-bank]]
- For developers: Added more information on how to [[get help|dendron.dev.setup#getting-help]] when getting started with Dendron development. 


### Ongoing 
-   We're still working on the [crop](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/219) from a couple weeks ago. Will take a few weeks to sprout but on track to be ready before July!
