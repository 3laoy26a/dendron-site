Dendron is an open source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool built on top of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Like most such tools,  Dendron supports all the usual features you would expect from modern note taking like tagging, backlinks, a graph view, split panes, etc. 

I originally created Dendron because I'd accumulated over **20k notes** on programming and various other topics and couldn't find a tool that would let me easily add and find notes from within my knowledge base. 

Traditional note taking tools are often **too rigid** by having an in-flexible hierarchy that doesn't let you file a note in multiple places. Newer tools are **too flexible** by eschewing hierarchies altogether in favor of relying solely on backlinks. 

Dendron finds the **usable center** between the two extremes by supporting the linking of any two arbitrary notes through backlinks while also maintaining a **canonical hierarchy** for every note. We do this through a form of **structured note taking** that relies on the combination of [[hierarchies | dendron.topic.hierarchies ]], [[schemas | dendron.topic.schema]], and [[path based lookups | dendron.topic.lookup]]. Read our [[quickstart | dendron.quickstart]] to learn about the details.

# Use Cases

Whether you organize your notes with [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) or [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), link notes together like [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), or simply create notes in an ad-hoc manner, Dendron can help.

Think of it as a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) to help you **make sense** of all the information you care about.

Some popular use cases include:
- project management 
- personal knowledge base of things you've learned
- CRM to keep track of clients, friends and enemies
- recipe book

We created Dendron to be a better way to **create, organize, and publish** information that matters to you.
