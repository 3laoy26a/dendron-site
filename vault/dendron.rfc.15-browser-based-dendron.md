## Goals

Creating a quick way to launch Dendron with minimal setup will lower the "Time to delight" experienced by our customers. It also opens the potential for supporting the iPad and other similar tablets while ensuring the portability of your notes. 



## Proposal

The quickest Dendron needs to run in managed code-server instances

## Context
Right now, it requires multiple manual steps to run Dendron detailed in [[Getting Started|dendron.tutorial]].
