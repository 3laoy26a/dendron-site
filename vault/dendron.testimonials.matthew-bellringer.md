>I've been using Dendron for a few months now and I'm hugely impressed. It's a great idea and Kevin's developing new features for it all the time. It has an active, engaged community and is growing rapidly. I really appreciate the open philosophy behind it, having got stuck in far too many proprietary note-taking systems in the past. I'm using it not only to organise my private notes but to publish on the internet (https://iaq.matthewbellringer.com) and to collaborate with others.
