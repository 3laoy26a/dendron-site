### Bug Fixes
- **time decorator lose position**: updating the frontmatter will cause the time decorator to sometimes lose its position
- **time decorator not updating**: turned off temporarily to investigate performance impact
- **rename note**: doesn't update all links in some cases

### Other 
- we've created a **bug catcher** role for folks that reported bugs to Dendron. currently trying to backfill with all the people that have contributed bugs. feel free to ping me if I missed you and big thanks to the current bug catchers!
