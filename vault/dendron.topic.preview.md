## Summary

The preview pane renders the Dendron's markdown text into nicely formatted HTML. The preview is a fork of the [markdown-preview-enhanced extension](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced). 

All documentation pertaining to the original extension can be found [here](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/). This page will highlight some key features as well as Dendron specific additions. 

## Setup
