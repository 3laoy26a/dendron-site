## Checklist
- [ ] Make sure you have unit tests 
- [ ] (case-specific) if you are adding a new language feature (graphically visible in vscode/preview/publishing), make sure that it is included in [test-workspace](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/feat/hashtag-tags/test-workspace/dendron.yml#L1:L1). We use this to manually inspect new changes and for auto regression testiing
