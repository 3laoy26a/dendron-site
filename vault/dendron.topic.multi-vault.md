# Multi Vault

Multi vault lets you create multiple vaults for a given workspace. Each vault is a folder that can contain any number of hierarchies. 

## Use Cases
- for **sensitive notes**, multi-vault enables local only vaults vs vaults that can are synced on file sharing services like dropbox 
- for **modularizing knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to mix and match existing vaults depending on context
- for **federating and curating knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to publish/subscribe to public vaults using protocols like `git`
- for **access control**, multi-vault lets users configure specific vaults to be **private** which turns off publication and sharing of any notes inside said vault
