## Goals

Improve the abilitys of schemas.

## Context

(feel free to request the links I should add here)

## Proposal

This is a proposal of multiple features, each indivitual feature will have its own page. The order has no meaning.

1. [[Types|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.types]]
    The ability to specify types for a schema.
1. [[Pattern|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.pattern]] match result usage
1. [[Reusability|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.reusability]]
1. [[Vault Specific|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.vault-specific]]
1. [[UI Options|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.ui-options]]


## Details

Schemas have so much potential and the features that are listed here could help use this potential.
