# Publishing ðŸš§

Dendron lets you publish the contents of your vault, either in its entirety or only a subset. What gets published is controlled by the `dendron.yml` file located inside your workspace. 

## Limitations

- publishing only works with pages but not any assets that you might have (eg. images pasted using `Paste Images`)
- currently not possible to publish multiple domains
  - current options when it comes to publishing are either everything (by setting noteRoot to `root`), one domain, or nothing
  - If you would like this feature, you can vote for it [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/64).

## dendron.yml
```yml
site:
  # the note that will serve as the root of your published website
  # by default, dendron will set the root to `root`
  # 
  # this means the contents of `root.md` will be set as your home 
  # page and that all the contents # of your vault will be published
  # 
  # you can change the root to a specific `domain` 
  # this will set that `domain` as the home page
  # and publish everything under that domain
  noteRoot: root
  # there's usually a built step before publishing your site
  # eg. converting your markdown files into jekyll-compatible
  # markdown files
  # 
  # this controls where the new documents will be published
  siteRoot: docs
```

### Example publishing entire vault
- vault
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ root.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.quickstart.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.zen.md
â”œâ”€â”€ flowers.md
â””â”€â”€ flowers.bud.md
```
- dendron.yml
```yml
publish:
  root: root
```
- what gets published

```
.
â””â”€â”€ root.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ dendron
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.quickstart
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dendron.zen
    â””â”€â”€ flowers
        â””â”€â”€ flowers.bud
```

### Example publishing just one domain
- vault
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ root.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.quickstart.md
â””â”€â”€ dendron.zen.md
```
- dendron.yml
```yml
publish:
  root: dendron
```
- published:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ dendron
    â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.quickstart
    â””â”€â”€ dendron.zen
```

## Steps

### Pre-requisites
- Make sure you have a `docs` folder inside `dendron.rootDir`.
    - If you've created your workspace using `Dendron: Initialize Workspace` on 0.4.2 or later, this is already done 
    - If you've created your workspace before `0.4.2` or have manually created your workspace, you can run `Dendron: Doctor` to create this folder
/pages/)
- Setup a github repo with [github pages enabled](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)
  - when selecting the source, make sure to pick `master branch/docs folder`

- Create an initial commit and push your vault to your github page

### Guide
1. Depending on what notes you want to publish, you will want to update your `dendron.yml` file. By default, everything will be published
2. When you are ready to publish, run the `> Dendron: Build Pod` command to prepare your site for publication. This builds your notes into the `siteRoot` directory which defaults to `docs`.
