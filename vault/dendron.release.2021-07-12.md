Dendron 0.50 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

### Highlights

- **Block reference anchors** are now hidden from published sites. 
- **Header references autocomplete**. Header autocomplete works for all your notes. Type `[[#` to find all headers in your current note and `[[note.name#` to find a header in a particular note. 
- **Block reference autocomplete**. Any block in the current not can be referenced (and the reference is automatically added). Just type `[[^` to find all arbitrary blocks you can reference in your current note. 
- **Show/hide labels** in the graph view so you can enjoy a more minimalist view of the graph if you want. 
- **Github import pod.** Now, you can import issues directly from Github and have them show up as notes! Learn more [[here|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.github]]
