Dendron 0.50 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

### Highlights

- **Block reference anchors** are now hidden from published sites. 
- **Header references autocomplete**. Header autocomplete works for all your notes. Type `[[#` to find all headers in your current note and `[[note.name#` to find a header in a particular note. 
- **Block reference autocomplete**. Any block in the current not can be referenced (and the reference is automatically added). Just type `[[^` to find all arbitrary blocks you can reference in your current note. 
- **Autocomplete for multi-vault.** When your workspace has multiple vaults, autocomplete now prioritizes notes in the current vault over notes in other vaults. 
- **Show/hide labels** in the graph view so you can enjoy a more minimalist view of the graph if you want. 

#### Fixes
- Clicking on links in Preview work on Windows
