## Summary

How to take notes on mobile devices

## Details

There are many apps that can take Markdown on mobile devices. We cover many of them in [[blog.2021.2021-10-25-markdown-on-mobile]].

Another approach that you can take is to use tools like [google keep](https://keep.google.com/u/0/) to capture stray thoughts while on the go and then consolidate them in Dendron when you're back on a computer.
