### seeds

What seeds a workspace depends on. When initializing a workspace with seeds, Dendron will automatically fetch the given vaults.

Optionally, you can provide the registry where this seed will be installed from. Unless specified, the default is `root` which is Dendron's public seed endpoint. In the future, we will populate this with additional properties (eg. version).

Format:
- {name-of-seed}: SeedConfig?

Which registry to look at . Currently, the only option is `root` which is the default registry used by Dendron

Identical to `visibilty for vaults`. 

![[dendron.ref.vaults#visibility,1:#*]]

##### addAttribution
