## Summary

In Dendron, your **workspace** is the root of where all your files are located. It's set when you first run `Dendron: Initialize Workspace`. The folder that contains your workspace is also known as your **workspace root**.

A workspace has a `dendron.yml` file that specifies its [[vaults|dendron.ref.vaults]].
