## Summary

Work in progress represents code that is currently being refactored

## Workspace Startup

We are splitting up Dendron initiliazation so that Dendron can work both when a code workspace is open and when it is not. 

Work remaining:
- replacing all instances of `DendronWorkspace.instance` 
- replace `getWS` with `getWSV2`
