## Summary

![[dendron://dendron-site/dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank#goals,1:#*]]

## Requesting new Seeds

We are planning on adding many more content to this registry over time. To help us prioritize, we've 
created the [Seed Request Template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=seed-request.md&title=) on GitHub so you can request new subjects you want to see in the seed bank.

## Contributing a Seed
- [[Work In Progress ðŸš§|dendron.ref.status#work-in-progress-]]

<!-- If you have a vault that you think would make a good addition to the seed bank, you can submit a vault by following the instructions below:

1. make sure your vault is pushed to a public git registry like github
2. make sure that your vault has a public `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` inside the vault
3. ping kevin on Discord or by email at [kevin@dendron.so](mailto:kevin@dendron.so) :)
