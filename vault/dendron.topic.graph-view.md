## Summary

-   Visualize the notes and schemas in your workspace in a graph view
-   Click on a node to open up the corresponding note/schema in your workspace
-   Much faster startup times than the legacy note/schema graph
    -   Scales to virtually any size graph

## Commands

### Show Note Graph V2

Launch the command bar (see [[docs|dendron.guides.cook#launch-the-command-bar]]): `> Dendron: Show Note Graph V2`

Click on a node to open up the corresponding note in your workspace.

The note graph currently only supports hierarchical note connections. Future versions of the graph will support linked note connections and the ability to add custom filters and styling to your graph.

### Show Schema Graph V2
- [[Early Seed ðŸŒ±|dendron.ref.status#early-seed-]] 

Launch the command bar (see [[docs|dendron.guides.cook#launch-the-command-bar]]): `> Dendron: Show Schema Graph V2`

Click on a node to open up the corresponding schema in your workspace.

The schema graph shows high level connections between a vault's `root` schema and other schemas within the vault. These other schemas may have other nodes connected to them representing additional children of that schema.

## Filter View

In the top left of both the note and schema graphs lives the graph filter view. This UI element contains information about the graph and various filtering options.

### Connections

-   **Hierarchy:** When checked, include hierarchical graph connections
-   **Links:** When checked, include linked note connections

## Legacy Note Graph

Dendron provides support for graph view using a fork of the [markdown-links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links) extension.

The Dendron graph view is generated using our hierarchical index. It also shows different relationships than most of the graph views you're probably used to.

Instead of showing edges as links between nodes, Dendron edges are the hierarchical relationships between your notes. Think of it as a 20,000 foot view of the structure of your knowledge base.

Note that this command is not optimized for performance and you might notice slowdowns if you have more than a few hundred notes. If you are running into performance issues, please upvote this [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/107) to prioritize the performance work!

#### Dendron: Show Schema Graph

Launch the command bar (see [link](https://www.dendron.so/notes/401c5889-20ae-4b3a-8468-269def4b4865.html#launch-the-command-bar) for info): `> Dendron: Show Schema Graph`

Show your note schemas visually in a graph. Schemas will be labelled by their `title` attribute. If `title` is not set, default to its `id`.
