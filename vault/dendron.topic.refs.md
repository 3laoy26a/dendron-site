# References ðŸš§

Dendron allows you to reference content from other notes and embed them in your current note.

Currently, Dendron supports 3 types of references:

- note references
- block references
- block range references

References have the following syntax

```
((
    ref: [[ NAME_OF_NOTE ]]                     # name of note, required
    #STARTING_HEADER                            # optional
    :#ENDING_HEADER                             # optional
))
```


- NOTE: Dendron has a `Copy Note Ref` command that will copy the reference of the current note.


## Note Reference

A note reference will include the entire contents of a note within another note. Below is an example of a note reference.

```
((ref:[[demo.embed.block]]))
```

## Block Reference
A block reference will include the entire contents of a note starting from a specified heading. 

```
((ref:[[demo.embed.block]]#head1))
```

## Block Range Reference
A block range reference will include the contents of a note starting from a `start` header and ending at a `end` header. 

```
((ref:[[demo.embed.block]]#head1:#head3))
```

## Note Reference Offset

A note reference offset is a way to skip a number of lines when using a note reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embeding.
- NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value

```
((ref:[[demo.embed.block]]#head1,1))
```
