The Dendron workbench is the overall UI that surrounds the editor. It is equivalent to the [VSCode workbench](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/extending-workbench).

Dendron has a few custom workbench components to deal with hierarchal notes.

## Output View

The Dendron Calendar View has the following capabilities:

- Clicking on a given day without a daily journal note will create one
- Days without daily journal note are grayed out and days that contain an entry are displayed in white.
- Shows indicators in the form of dots (max 5) to reflect the word count of that entry. Each dot repesents 250 words.
- Switching between month/year view
- In a multi-vault workspace it shows the daily journal from the vault associated with the active note

## Working with Multiple Columns

VSCode lets you create multiple columns of your editor and arrange them any way you want them.

### Expanding the Current Editor

You can use the `toggleEditorWidth` command with a hotkey to quickly expand the current editor.

```json
{
    "command": "workbench.action.toggleEditorWidths",
    "key": "ctrl+cmd+m"
}
```
