## Summary

Your workspace is made up of **vaults**. A dendron vault stores a collection of related notes. If you're familiar with git, it's just like a code repo. By default, Dendron creates a _vaults_ folder when you first initialize a **workspace**. All your notes are stored on a per vault basis.

```
.
â””â”€â”€ workspace
    â”œâ”€â”€ vault.main
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo.md
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo.one.md
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ foo.two.md
    â””â”€â”€ vault.secret (hypothetical)
        â”œâ”€â”€ secret.one.md
        â””â”€â”€ secret.two.md
```

By default, when you look for notes in Dendron, it will search over all vaults.

## Commands

### Vault Add
- shortcuts: none

Add a new vault to your workspace.

When you add a vault, you can choose between adding a local vault or a remote vault.

#### Local Vault

A local vault is a folder in your file system.

#### Remote Vault

A remote vault is a git repository. If you choose a remote vault, you can choose from a vault from the registry or enter a custom git url.

We currently have four vaults in the registry: `dendron.so`, `aws.dendron.so`, `tldr.dendron.so and `xkcd.dendron.so`. These correspond to the notes backing https://dendron.so/ and https://aws.dendron.so/ respectively.

Note that when you add a remote vault, the url can also point to a remote workspace. In that case, dendron will inspect the `dendron.yml` to get a list of all vaults within the workspace and add all vaults from inside the workspace.

### Vault Remove

- shortcuts: none

Remove a vault

Remove a vault from your workspace. Note that the underlying files will **not** be deleted - the vault will lose its association with your workspace.

## Vault Sources

When adding new vaults, your vault can come from either of the following sources:
- local 
- remote

### Local 

A local vault is what you start off with. Its a vault that is local to your file system.

### Remote

A remote vault is what you get when you run the [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] command and select a remote vault. This is a vault that is cloned from a git repo. It should be a similar format as what you see below

```yml
vaults:
    -
        fsPath: dendron
        remote:
            type: git
            url: 'git@github.com:dendronhq/dendron.git'
```

When someone pulls down a workspace with a `dendron.yml` that contains a remote vault, Dendron will automatically initialize the vault at the given `fsPath`. If the vault is a [[Workspace Vault|dendron.ref.vaults#workspace-vault]], Dendron will pull downt the workspace to `{workspaceName}/fsPath`. 

## Vault Types

### Regular Vault

A regular vault is what you get by default when you first initialize your workspace. 

### Workspace Vault
- [[Early Seed ðŸŒ±|dendron.ref.status#early-seed-]]

A workspace vault is a vault that belongs to another [[workspace|dendron.ref.workspace]]. It is automatically created when you run [[Vault Add|dendron.ref.vaults#vault-add]] on a [[workspace|dendron.ref.workspace]]. Upon adding a workspace, Dendron will add all the vaults of the given workspace inside your `dendron.yml` 

You can see an example of the configuration [[here|dendron.ref.vaults#remote-workspace-vault]].

## Configuration

### fsPath
- file path to vault

### name
- default: last component of `fsPath`

vault name 

### visibility
- choices: "private|public"

If set to private, notes in this vault will not be published regardless of any other configuration. This takes precedences over everything. 

### workspace
- required: false

If set, specifies the workspace that this vault belongs

### remote
- added property for [[remote vaults|dendron.ref.vaults#remote]]
- properties
    - type: currently only `git` is supported (in the future, we might add additional types)
    - url: url to github repo

### Configuration Examples
#### Local Vault

```yml
vaults:
    - fsPath: vault
```

This will have the following file layout

```
.
â””â”€â”€ workspace
    â””â”€â”€ vault

```

#### Remote Vault 
```yml
vaults:
    -
        fsPath: dendron-vault
        remote:
            type: git
            url: 'git@github.com:kevinslin/dendron-vault.git'
        name: dendron
    -
        fsPath: yc-vault
        remote:
            type: git
            url: 'git@github.com:kevinslin/yc-vault.git'
        name: yc
```

This will have the following file layout
```
.
â””â”€â”€ workspace
    |â”€â”€ dendron-vault
    â””â”€â”€ yc-vault

```

#### Remote Workspace Vault

```yml
vaults:
    -
        fsPath: handbook
        workspace: handbook
        name: handbook
workspaces:
    handbook:
        remote:
            type: git
            url: 'git@github.com:dendronhq/handbook.git'

```

This will have the following file layout
```
.
â””â”€â”€ workspace
    â””â”€â”€ handbook
        â””â”€â”€ handbook

```
