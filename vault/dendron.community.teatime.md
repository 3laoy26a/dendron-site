## Summary

Teatime is a channel (both voice and text) for Dendron contributors.

When you join the `#teatime` channel, it means that you are down for having a conversation with a fellow dendrologist. 

The teatime channel is available to anyone that has a [[role|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.community.roles#roles]] in the Dendron community.

You're free to discuss anything at all in the `#teatime` channel. To help, we encourage using the pinned read in the [[Dendron Reading Series|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.community.what-are-you-reading#dendron-reading-series]] as a starting point.
