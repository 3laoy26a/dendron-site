Dendron 0.48 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

### Highlights
- Markdown pod supports exporting to folders. Export your Dendron vault to Github/Gitlab native wikis! 
- No more merge conflicts in a shared vault! The `updated` timestamp will no longer update if you have no material updates to the notes (simply opening and saving a file doesn't count). 
- Bad frontmatter no longer crashes Dendron. 
- Cursor moves to the end of opened notes and frontmatter folds by default. 
- Support filtering graph by regex and stubs

### Docs

Our documentation changes a lot week by week. Below is a highlight of some updates from the past week.


### Ongoing 
-   We're still working on the [crop](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/219) from a couple weeks ago. Will take a few weeks to sprout but on track to be ready early July!
