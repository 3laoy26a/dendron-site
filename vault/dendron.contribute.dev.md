# Development

If you would like to contribute to the development of dendron, checkout out the [repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron) from github.

You can then follow the setup instructions below to prepare your first commit!

A great place to start is with issues labelled with the [size.small label](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/size.small) on github. These are items that we picked out specifically for first time contributors and are small self contained task that are well suited for first time contributors.

Remember that you are always welcome to ask for help inside the [#dev discord channel](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9).
