- NOTE: if you'd rather follow a video tutorial, fellow dendrologist [Ian Jones](https://github.com/theianjones) made a fantastic video series which you can follow [here](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-personal-knowledge-management-system-with-dendron-b24b)

## Pre-requisites

This walkthrough will help you get started with Dendron. Before you start, make sure you have Dendron installed. If not, you can do so by following the instructions [[here|dendron.guides.install]].

### Your first workspace

After you've started Dendron, you should see a screen like the one below (depending on your color theme, your colors might look different).
