## Pre-requisites

This walkthrough will help you get started with Dendron. Before you start, make sure you do the following:
- installed [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or a VSCode compatible editor like [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
- installed [Dendron](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron) from the code marketplace
- initialize your first Dendron workspace

When you first install Dendron, you can click on the green `Initialize Workspace` button on the Welcome screen to initialize your first workspace. Then, pick a location to store your notes, and you'll be brought to the tutorial experience, which will contain notes with the same tutorial content here.
