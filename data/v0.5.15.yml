        Do you have regrets? While there are some things that you can't take back, mis-naming a note should never be one of them. Dendron now let's you rename files and will update all links in all files that link to it!

        Schemas now automatically apply their description to newly created notes that match said schema. Because life is too short to annotate all your notes all the time.

        All the oneliners and bad jokes that you have for that special someone? Type them out faster than ever with built in snippets. This updates the default settings to allow tab-based snippet completion and also initialize new vaults with some default snippets.

    desc: |
        We know that sometimes, it can't be helped and you'll need to work with your notes outside of Dendron. If that work is deleting notes, Dendron will now keep track of it and remove it from its lookup index as well!
