# Creating Notes

### Creating Notes

While we call it the `Lookup Bar`, you can also use it to create notes that don't exist. When you lookup for a note that hasn't been created, Dendron will create it for you. 

To try it yourself, bring up the lookup bar. Type `dendron.lookup.hello` and hit `Enter`.

#### Creating Special Notes

Dendron has builtin notion for certain types of notes with [pre-defined hierarchies](5c213aa6-e4ba-49e8-85c5-1bdcb33ce202). These notes can be created by toggling the corresponding **note button**  on the lookup menu or by using the respective builtin shortcuts.

- values:
  - none (default): create a regular note
  - journal: create a journal note (cmd/ctrl + shift + j)
  - scratch: create a scratch note (cmd/ctrl + shift + s)

### Creating Notes with a Selection

If you have text highlighted while creating a new note with a lookup, the new note will be created using the text selected. How the text will be used depends on  the `dendron.defaultLookupCreateBehavior` setting.

- values: 
  - selectionExtract (default): create new note with text from the old note. remove text from the old note
  - selection2link: create new empty note and turn selection into a link referencing the old note
