## [0.12.10](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.10-alpha.4...v0.12.10) (2020-10-16)

### Features

#### Rename and Refactor Commands an Order of Magnitude Faster Now (server mode) ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

These commands have been completely re-written and use a proper markdown parser to find links (vs many fragile regex statements). 
The re-write results in both much faster performance as well as a more correct implementation. 

### Enhancements

- **progress indicator on startup (server mode)**: loading indicator to help with large workspaces
- **rename command support (server mode)**: rename command is now available in server mode
- **refactor command support (server mode)**: refactor hierarchy command is now available in server mode
- **publish notes support (server mode)**: publish notes command is now available in server mode
- **archive command support (server mode)**: archive hierarchy is now available in server mode
- **doctor command support (server mode)**: doctor command is now available in server mode

### Bug Fixes

- **schema templates not working (server mode)**: issue where schema templates were not being applied

### Other

- we've created a **bug catcher** role for folks that reported bugs to Dendron. currently trying to backfill with all the people that have contributed bugs. feel free to ping me if I missed you and big thanks to the current bug catchers!
