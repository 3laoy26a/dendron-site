## [0.12.9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.9-alpha.1...v0.12.9) (2020-10-15)

### Features

#### Human Friendly Timestamps (server mode)

Timestamps now have human friendly decorators on the side.

### Enhancements

- **copyAssets configuration**: when publishing, you can now toggle whether you want to copy assets or not
- **dump state**: dendron now has a `Dump State` command which will dump the internal state into the logs (useful for debugging)

### Bug Fixes

- **assets not being copied:** assets not copied on publishing when `assetsPrefix` was set
- **GoUp comman go to wrong note (server mode):** GoUp would sometimes try to open a stub node which would result in an error
- **Multiple workspaces result in bad timestamps (server mode):** Having multiple workspaces of the same vaults open could result in bad timestamps

### Error upgrading

![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble.upgrade.png)

Dendron will update keybindings/settings/etc to the latest defaults if not currently set on upgrade. If you see the above error, it means that Dendron had trouble parsing one of your settings files. This doesn't stop dendron from starting but it does mean that the latest settings aren't being applied.

The most likely culprit of this error is a bad snippets file. To fix, bring up the command prompt, type `>Configure User Snippets`, open `dendron.code-snippets` and see if there's anything funky with the json on the line mentioned by the error. You can also use tools like [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your JSON.
