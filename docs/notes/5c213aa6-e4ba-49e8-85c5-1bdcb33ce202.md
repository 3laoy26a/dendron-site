# Special Notes

Dendron has builtin support for a variety of special note formats. These notes can be created using regular lookup - these commands provide convenient shortcuts for frequently used notes. 

## Journal Note

A journal note is a self contained note that is meant to track something over time. Examples of journals include recording **workout sessions**, making **meeting notes**, and keeping a **mood journal**.

To create a journal note, use the command bar to select the `>Dendron: New Journal Note` command. 

By default, Dendron will create the journal note with the following hierarchy `{domain}.journal.{Y-MM-DD}`. `{domain}` is the **domain** of the current active note when you execute `New Journal Note`. You can change the date format by setting the `dendron.defaultJournalDateFormat` config value in your settings.

Dendron will also copy the link to the note in your clipboard so you can easily create backlinks in other notes.

## Scratch Note

A scratch note is a self contained note that is meant to be used as scratchpad. Use it for thoughts or when you want to expand on a bullet point. Scratch notes are created in the `scratch` domain and have the following format: `{domain}.journal.{Y-MM-DD-HHHHmmss}`. You can change the date format by setting the `dendron.defaultScratchDateFormat` config value in your settings.

If you highlight text while creating a scratch note, the highlighted text will automatically be turned into a link to the new scratch note.
