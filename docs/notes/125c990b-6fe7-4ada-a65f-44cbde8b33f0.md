If you would like to contribute to the development of dendron, checkout out the [repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron) from github.

You can then follow the setup instructions below to prepare your first commit!

A great place to start is with issues labelled with the [size.small label](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/size.small) on github. These are items that we picked out specifically for first time contributors and are small self contained task that are well suited for first time contributors.

Remember that you are always welcome to ask for help inside the [#dev discord channel](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9).

## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

Before you begin, you need to make sure to have the following SDKs and tools:

- [Node.js >= 12.0.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/)
  - We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)

### 2. Clone and npm install

```console
git clone https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron.git
cd dendron
npm install
```

### 3. Build Repo

- you should run this when building dendron for the first time and also every time you run a git pull
  - new dependencies might have been picked up between pulls and this makes sure that they are installed

```sh
./bootstrap/scripts/init.sh
```

- we recommend you use `vscode` to develop for dendron. there is a `dendron.code-workspace` file in the root of the monorepo that you should use when developing

### 4. Start Debugging (the plugin)

- NOTE: you don't need to do this if you are not directly working on the extension (eg. you're working on the [server](7cdd9a74-8b8f-4564-906b-c963bed34273))

To start an instance of the Dendron with the Debugger, Run `Extension (plugin-core)` from the debug panel in vscode

![debugger](/assets/images/start_debugger.gif)

_Note: Running via Run -> Start Debugging will not work unless you've previously targeted `Extension (plugin-core)`_

## Tips

To continuously compile all dependencies, run the following

```sh
./bootstrap/scripts/watch.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

In case something something goes wrong with a build step or you want to save time by not running everything, `init.sh` is just a thin wrapper around the following scripts, each of which can be run individually

- ./bootstrap/scripts/bootstrap.sh: `lerna bootstrap all packages`
- ./bootstrap/scripts/build.sh: `lerna build all packages`
- initialize template repo (this bundles the latest [dendron-template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-template) with the plugin so that the right notes are initialized when a user creates their first workspace)

```sh
 cd packages/plugin-core/
 ./scripts/sync_vault.sh
```

## Testing

- see [Testing](cb22bd36-d45a-4ffd-a31e-96c4b39cb7fb)

## Debugging

- see [Debugging](b239c77e-52f2-4cc3-8390-69e0bc776a72)

If you are interested in contributing to Dendron but haven't spent your career doing software, worry not. This is definitely something you can ðŸŒ± into.

We have lots of resources to help you make your first contribution.

If you are completely new to software development, I would encourage you to look at the following resources:

- primer to typescript (everything in Dendron is based on this): <https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html>
- go through the javascript course: <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript>

When your ready to make a contribution, you can follow the instructions in the [development page](81da87be-2d4e-47b5-a1d6-c0d647e1ab00)

I'm also planning on streaming some dendron development on twitch in the coming weeks to show my workflow for working with Dendron and will give you a heads up when I'm doing them.
