# Caching

One use of a knowledge base is that of a [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) - quickly referencing information you have seen or worked with before. 

The most important properties of an effective cache:

- fast referencing (of an existing note)
- fast writing (of a new note)
- fast updating (of existing notes)

Dendron is ideally suited for this knowledge-as-a-cache use case. 

- [Dendron lookups](a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3) provide fast reading/writing of both new and existing notes
- [Dendron schemas](c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052) help structure your knowledge even as you accumulate more notes

## Example

You can see a public example of what this might look like on [Kevin's project reference hierarchy](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/f46d3d6c-9704-4ddc-ad7d-69612d214905.html). He keeps public reference notes on projects he's used. 

Some things to note: 

- when using your notes as a cache, you might have duplicate content from other sites. be aware of copyright laws and check that you can re-publish said content
- when re-publishing content, google will penalize your site if you have duplicate content from other sites. you can tell google to not index specific pages or hierarchies
    

## Exclude page from index


To tell google to not index a page, you can add the following tag to the frontmatter. You can also have this as a default for a given hierarchy by setting `noIndexByDefault: true` in the site config.

```yml
...
noindex: true
```


## Exclude hierarchy from index

- set [noindexByDefault](73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e) to true in your site hierarchy specific config
