### Publishing V2 (preview)

We've re-build publishing for Dendron from the ground up to be faster, better, and easier to use.

Besides for schemas, publishing has consistently been one of the hardest to use features in Dendron. Dendron currently publishes using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using our own [template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). While this has served as well initially, slow compile times for large sites and difficulty of getting started has made it a growing pain point.

To address this, we've migrated our publishing stack to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a super fast javascript based static generator. This means much faster, and perhaps more importantly, easier publishing. 

There's still some work left to integrate publishing into the Dendron plugin - meanwhile, you can take the new publishing workflow for a spin using the [dendron cli](8b03ed06-4f46-46e0-8652-c6abf2266a79)

In order to to use the 11ty based publishing, initialize your workspace with the following commands.

```sh
npm init -y
npm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest
npm install @dendronhq/dendron-11ty@latest
```

After you have your dependencies installed, build your your site using the following command.

```sh
npx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage dev --serve
```

This will both compile your site locally and make it available at `localhost:8080` for instant preview. When building your site locally, the pages will be build to `{wsRoot}/build/site`. 

When you are ready to publish to github, make sure to change the stage to `prod`.

```sh
npx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage prod 
```

This will build your site to the path specified by [siteRootDir](ffa6a4ba-5eda-48c7-add5-8e2333ba27b4#siterootdir) in `dendron.yml`. 

#### Benchmarks

Publishing V2 is ~10x faster than jekyll based publishing for sites with +100 pages. For comparison, below is the compilation difference between building the dendron site using 11ty vs jekyll. 

- 11ty: 24.45s
- jekyll: 220.33s

There are additional optimizations still on the table that will further drive down he compilation time by another order of magnitude for future releases. 

#### Gaps

11ty publishing is currently not at full feature parity with Jekyll publishing. Notably, the following features are missing:

- setting a custom color theme
- `edit on github` links
- `jekyll-seo` functionality
- `nav_order` not respected 
- `nav_exclude` not respected

#### Migration

All values that used to be written into `_config.yml` will now be moved into `dendron.yml`. You can see the currently supported configuration values here: `https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types.ts#L71:L71`

If you currently have a Jekyll based Dendron page, note that the following settings have changed:

- the `url` property from `_config.yml` is now `siteUrl` in `dendron.yml`
- favicon is now controlled by `siteFaviconPath` in `dendron.yml` and is a path relative to your workspace root
- `CNAME` is now controlled by `githubCname` property in `dendron.yml`

#### Sample dendron.yml config

- publishing without a cname

```yml
version: 1
vaults:
    - fsPath: vault
site:
    copyAssets: true
    siteHierarchies:
        - dendron
    siteRootDir: docs
    siteUrl: "kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test"
    usePrettyRefs: true
```

- using custom cname

```yml
version: 1
vaults:
    - fsPath: vault
site:
    copyAssets: true
    siteHierarchies:
        - dendron
    siteRootDir: docs
    usePrettyRefs: true
    siteUrl: "11ty.dendron.so"
    githubCname: "11ty.dendron.so"
```

#### Sample repo

- [github repo](https://github.com/kevinslin/dendron-11ty-test/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages)
- [github page](https://kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test/)

#### CLI Command Reference

```sh
dendron-cli buildSiteV2
