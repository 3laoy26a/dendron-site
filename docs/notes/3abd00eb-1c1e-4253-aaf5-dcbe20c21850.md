The Dendron Seed Bank is a registry of public vaults that you can add to your workspace. At this time, we are launching with two vaults in the seed bank:

- dendron-site: this mirrors the content from <http://dendron.so/>
- aws: this mirrors the content from <http://aws.dendron.so/>

The vision for the seed bank is to create a repository of open source vaults that provide both notes and schemas for all the things that people care about.

## Requesting a Vault

We are planning on adding many more vaults to this registry over time. To help us prioritize, we've 
created the [Seed Request Template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=seed-request.md&title=) on GitHub so you can request new subjects you want to see in the seed bank.

## Submitting a Vault

If you have a vault that you think would make a good addition to the seed bank, you can submit a vault by following the instructions below:

1. make sure your vault is pushed to a public git registry like github
2. make sure that your vault has a public `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` inside the vault
3. ping kevin on Discord or by email at [kevin@dendron.so](mailto:kevin@dendron.so) :)

#### Support refactor for multi-vault

One of our most requested features for multi-vault is now out. Refactor will now work across multiple vaults. All rename operations take place in the same vault as the file being renamed (so a refactor operation that affects files in multiple vaults will end up renaming files within each vault). You can see an example of this below:

```
.
├── vault1
│   └── bond.one
└── vault2
    └── bond.two
```

- after refactoring `bond -> james`

```
.
├── vault1
│   └── james.one
└── vault2
    └── james.two
```

#### Support Specifying Vault Location when Creating a Note

<div class="portal-container">
<div class="portal-head">
<div class="portal-backlink" >
<div class="portal-title">From <span class="portal-text-title">dendron.topic.multi-vault</span></div>
<a href="24b176f1-685d-44e1-a1b0-1704b1a92ca0.html" class="portal-arrow">Go to text <span class="right-arrow">→</span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div id="portal-parent-anchor" class="portal-parent" markdown="1">
<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

When creating a note in lookup, the currently opened note's vault is used as the vault for the new note.

</div>    
</div>

With this change, you can now pick the vault for new notes.  To enable,  add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` in the dendron configuration. Instructions to do so below.

1. > Dendron: Configure (yaml)
2. add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` so your configuration looks like the following:

```yml
version: 0
...
lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true
```
