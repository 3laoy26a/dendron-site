### Features

#### Experimental Multi-Vault Support

(Early Experimental ) [Multi Vault Support](45cfb9f2-46cf-4f67-a41e-834818fbd06e)  is here! Multi Vault lets you add additional [vaults](https://dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#vaults-) to your Dendron workspace.

Each vault is logically separate (they reside in separate directories) but can be universally queried using lookup.

Multi vault enables a bunch of exciting use cases.

- for **sensitive notes**, multi-vault enables local only vaults vs vaults that can are synced on file sharing services like dropbox 
- for **modularizing knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to mix and match existing vaults depending on context
- for **federating and curating knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to publish/subscribe to public vaults using protocols like `git`
- for **access control**, multi-vault lets users configure specific vaults to be **private** which turns off publication and sharing of any notes inside said vault

Currently, the following commands are supported with multi-vault:

- Lookup 
- Deleting a Note
- Navigating to a note using Tree View 

Other commands like rename/refactor will still work when performed in your primary vault. They will probably not work if performed against a note not inside your primary vault.

When you use **Lookup** to create a new note with multi vault, the note will be created inside the same vault as the current opened note. **Lookup** will also show you the vault that each note belongs to while performing lookup.

Currently known issues (with supported commands):

- unable to create a note using Lookup that has the same name as an existing note inside **any** of your vaults 
- unable to navigating to the root of a vault using Tree View

#### Vault Add Command

Add a new vault to your workspace.

#### Vault Remove Command

Remove a vault from your workspace. Note that the underlying files wil **not** be deleted - the vault will lose its association with your workspace.

### Enhancements

### Bug Fixes

- **engine:** init with empty config won't throw error ([7beb90f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/7beb90fa243bc73563a3ce16b5305345f7348d9f))
- **engine:** don't delete old note if new note wasn't created by rename ([de44f9f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/de44f9f4d38651d75433ae885fdc78bb762fb1f6))
- **notes:** fix issue when importing note that already exists ([a08a34a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a08a34a0563bb4047bd9c7cfc5f2bf150873fdc8))

### House Cleaning

- vault metadata will be added to `dendron.yml`
- `dendron.yml` comments will be stripped on workspace initialization

## 0.15.1

### Features

#### Wildcard Note Ref Links

- **refs:** wildcard note ref links ([98a1177](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/98a117715a967492ab9d7b8749d964b07bde4055))

[Note references](f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c) now accept the `*` operator at the end which lets you grab all notes of a given level of hierarchy. This also works with typical note reference operation like block selection which means you can use it to grab specific blocks from every note in a level.

#### Dendron: Configure Command

- **workbench:** add configure command ([db51dc3](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/db51dc35864d0c4434f70620ef0e88451c198fa4))

This is a quick way to update the `dendron.yml` file. You can run it by using `Dendron: Configure`

### Bug Fixes

- **notes:** fix issue when importing note that already exists ([a08a34a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a08a34a0563bb4047bd9c7cfc5f2bf150873fdc8))

### House Cleaning

- add `.dendron.ws` file under workspace to store workspace specific metadata
