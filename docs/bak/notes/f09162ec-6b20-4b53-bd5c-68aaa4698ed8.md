### Community

- Dendron Office Hours
  - We had our first live office hours this week. Thanks to everyone that participated! You can find the recording [here](https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/737323300967022732/778798279658962944). A reminder that you can submit questions ahead of time in the #office-hours channel in [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9). We'll send another survey this week for scheduling the next office hours at the end of the month. 

### House Cleaning

- Deprecation of `Dendron Markdown Notes`
  - prior to 0.17, Dendron used the aforementioned extension for language features like auto completion and following links
  - with 0.17, all language features is now being handled with Dendron
  - Dendron Markdown Notes is no longer required and can interfere with new definitions
  - You can uninstall Dendron Markdown Notes through the extensions panel inside VSCode
      ![uninstall ](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/etc.install.jpg)
- Version Number in DendronConfig
  - `dendron.yml` now has an added `version` field. It's automatically set to `0` for all current configurations. we'll be coming out with a new version in the near future to support additional multi-vault features

### In the Works

Most of the same items from last week still apply üòÖ

- a better **up to date** public roadmap
- bringing multi-vault to feature parity with all existing Dendron functionality
- a better publishing experience

![uninstall ](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/etc.install.jpg)

### Features

#### Support Relative Wiki Links

You can now navigate to a specific section within a note using relative wiki links: `[[foo#header]]` 

Note that the header is expected in [github slug](https://github.com/gosimple/slug) format. This means that spaces and special characters should be replaced with `-`. 

- **NOTE**: Relative wiki links currently don't work in the markdown-preview

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/b21501b47e64449882a369590a630d7f" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

#### Copy Relative Wiki Links

Similarly to copying a note ref, if you select any part of a header while running `Copy Note Link`, a relative wiki-link will be automatically generated.

<div class="portal-container">
<div class="portal-head">
<div class="portal-backlink" >
<div class="portal-title">From <span class="portal-text-title">dendron.topic.commands</span></div>
<a href="eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html" class="portal-arrow">Go to text <span class="right-arrow">‚Üí</span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div id="portal-parent-anchor" class="portal-parent" markdown="1">
<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>

  - key: `ctrl+shift+c`

#### All link features are now multi-vault aware

Link related features like navigation and auto complete can now detect notes in all vaults. 

When the same note exists in multiple vaults, Dendron will show you a prompt to pick the note you want to navigate to.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/1108e35e262c4d428629d0a4034090d0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

#### Link Completion with Aliases

You can now auto complete notes that have aliases. This was a common issue for folks that were using [pretty tags](8bc9b3f1-8508-4d3a-a2de-be9f12ef1821)

### Bug Fixes

- Issue with creating notes with same name in a new vault

### House Cleaning
